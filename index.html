    	<p><font size="5">Who am I?</font></p>
		<p>
			I'm an experienced engineering leader and technology enthusiast with a decade of expertise in mobile app development. I have a diverse skill set encompassing various technology stacks, including Flutter, native Android, native iOS, CI/CD pipelines, and Backend/API development. Throughout my career, I have successfully architected numerous mobile projects from scratch and led teams of more than 10 members for over four years. Additionally, I have a strong passion for helping others, as demonstrated by my extensive contributions on StackOverflow, where I have answered over 600 questions, reaching and assisting more than 3 million developers. I have also made significant contributions to the development of large-scale apps with millions of monthly active users, spanning various domains such as education, real estate, car auctioning, mobile payment solutions utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy, NFC, and QR codes, as well as apps for drug relapse prevention and secure web service logins leveraging chip cards and mobile devices.

					Most recently, I was an Engineering Director at WillowTree, a digital product agency that served Fortune 500 clients such as HBO, CBC, National Geographic, 21st Century Fox, PepsiCo, and Regal Cinemas, to design and build digital products and experiences. In my role, I was responsible for people management, client engagement, stakeholder engagement, technical architecture, coaching, mentoring, and other related activities.

    	<p><font size="5">What I have to offer?</font></p>
		<p>
			I believe that for creating something useful, its necessary for people with diverse professional backgrounds to come together. If you have a great idea that would have a positive effect on society, I would love to offer my skills.

		<p><font size="5">What are my beliefs?</font></p>
		<p>As an individual, I am not running behind money, prestige or fame. Its happiness what I crave for. To gain happiness, Chanakya, the very famous Indian philosopher and economist from 300 B.C has defined seven basic ingredients: <br><br>
पहला सुख निरोगी काया | दूजा सुख घर में हो माया ||<br>
तीजा सुख कुलवंत हो नारी | चौथा सुख सुत हो आज्ञाकारी ||<br>
पांचवा सुख हो सुंदर वासा | छठा सुख हो सज्जन पासा ||<br>
सातवा सुख हो मित्र घनेरे | ऐसे नर नहीं जग बहुतेरे ||<br>
<br>
It means that the foremost requirement of happiness is a healthy body. Second is having enough money to sustain a decent living. Third is having a beloved and faithful wife/husband. Fourth is to have obedient children. Fifth is to have a hospitable home. Sixth is always being surrounded by good people. Seventh is having faithful friends. One eighth additional ingredient which gives me tremendous joy is the act of giving.
