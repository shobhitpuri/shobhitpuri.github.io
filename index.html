    	<p><font size="5">Who am I?</font></p>
		<p>
			I'm an experienced engineering leader and technology enthusiast with over a decade of full-stack experience, specializing in the mobile ecosystem. I have successfully led numerous teams and projects from inception to completion, shaping their technical vision, strategy, and architecture, as well as supported those with more than 10 million monthly active users. These projects span various industries, including finance, education, real estate, and vehicle auctioning. I have worked with diverse technology stacks, including native Android, native iOS, Flutter, Backend/API development, AWS Infrastructure Development, and Generative AI.

	<p><font size="5">What's my passion?</font></p></p>
		<p>
			My passion lies in harnessing technology to create a positive impact, whether it's by aiding fellow developers or supporting organizations that strive to make a meaningful difference in people's lives. As one of the top 2% contributors on Stack Overflow, with over 610 Q&As, I've reached and impacted over 3.4 million developers on the platform. In addition, I had multiple open-source contributions, and I am actively involved in course creation for mobile developers, collaborating with platforms like Kodeco and Droidcon, which get millions of monthly visits. I also mentor aspiring professionals through Upnotch. My commitment to giving back extends to volunteering with NGOs such as Miracle Messages and the NYCH senior club, where I've developed apps to support their respective causes.

			<ul>
				<li>
					I have been running a company called Puri Technologies Ltd. which provides software development and consulting services.

					Most recently, I was an Engineering Director at WillowTree, a digital product agency that served Fortune 500 clients such as HBO, CBC, National Geographic, Fox, and PepsiCo, to design and build digital products and experiences. I spearheaded a diverse team of engineers while collaborating with one of the world's largest brewing company, and was responsible for people management, client engagement, stakeholder engagement, technical architecture, coaching, mentoring, and other related activities. 					
				</li>
				<li>
					In my spare time, I am actively working on creating courses for developers on Droidcon Academy, advising startups like TakeStock.ai, and mentoring on Upnotch.

    	<p><font size="5">What I have to offer?</font></p>
		<p>
			I believe that for creating something useful, its necessary for people with diverse professional backgrounds to come together. If you have a great idea that would have a positive effect on society, I would love to offer my skills.

		<p><font size="5">What are my beliefs?</font></p>
		<p>As an individual, I am not running behind money, prestige or fame. Its happiness what I crave for. To gain happiness, Chanakya, the very famous Indian philosopher and economist from 300 B.C has defined seven basic ingredients: <br><br>
पहला सुख निरोगी काया | दूजा सुख घर में हो माया ||<br>
तीजा सुख कुलवंत हो नारी | चौथा सुख सुत हो आज्ञाकारी ||<br>
पांचवा सुख हो सुंदर वासा | छठा सुख हो सज्जन पासा ||<br>
सातवा सुख हो मित्र घनेरे | ऐसे नर नहीं जग बहुतेरे ||<br>
<br>
It means that the foremost requirement of happiness is a healthy body. Second is having enough money to sustain a decent living. Third is having a beloved and faithful wife/husband. Fourth is to have obedient children. Fifth is to have a hospitable home. Sixth is always being surrounded by good people. Seventh is having faithful friends. One eighth additional ingredient which gives me tremendous joy is the act of giving.
